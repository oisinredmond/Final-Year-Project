# Final-Year-Project
## Oisin Redmond - C15492202 - DT228/4
This github repo contains the software prototype upload for the final submission of my Final Year Project.

The repo consists of three main folders:

1. **SurfsApp** - This is the Android Studio project folder for the client application. It contains
assets and code related to the client application, as well as other project files generated by Android Studio.

2. **Location Data** - This folder contains a short python script - parse_locations.py - written by the developer to parse a geojson file
and export location names and coordinates to a JSON file for use in the database. The geojson file  in this folder
was found at https://data.gov.ie/dataset/bathing-water-compliance

3. **Function** - This folder contains the Firebase Cloud Function project which is used to query the World Weather Online API
and update the forecast database. This script was deployed to Firebase as a cloud function and set to execute three times a day.
